## 💡 Recommended Approach

### Step 1: Complete Production Readiness (Phase 1-3)
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Effort:** 120-160 hours  
**Focus:** Make existing 13 tools production-ready

**Key Learnings from Testing:**
- Path handling needs normalization (`.md` extension inconsistencies)
- Caching behavior requires documentation and potential invalidation strategy
- Dual-mode (API/filesystem) adds testing complexity but works well
- Move operations work correctly but list caching may not reflect changes immediately

### Step 2: Implement High-Priority Phase 4 Tools
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Effort:** 52-68 hours  
**Focus:** Graph operations, templates, advanced search

**Implementation Notes:**
- Graph operations may need caching for performance with filesystem-only mode
- Template system should handle path normalization consistently
- Advanced search needs testing in both API and filesystem modes

### Step 3: Gather User Feedback
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Focus:** Understand which additional tools users want most

**Testing Platforms:**
- ✅ Windows (Kiro) - Tested successfully
- ✅ Windows (Cursor) - Tested successfully
- 📋 WSL (Claude Code) - Pending testing

### Step 4: Implement Additional Tools Based on Demand
**Timeline:** Variable  
**Focus:** Prioritize based on user requests

## 🧪 Testing Status & Insights

### Current Testing Coverage

| Platform | Status | Tools Tested | Results |
|----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Windows (Kiro) | ✅ Complete | All 13 core tools | Working |
| Windows (Cursor) | ✅ Complete | All 13 core tools | Working |
| WSL (Claude Code) | 📋 Pending | - | Not yet tested |

### Key Findings

**✅ What's Working Well:**
- Dual-mode operation (API + filesystem fallback)
- Clear error messages and warnings
- Move operations with wikilink warnings
- Daily note creation with templates
- Frontmatter updates
- Search functionality

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement:**
- Path handling inconsistency (`.md` extension)
- List caching doesn't immediately reflect moves
- Need path normalization layer
- Cache invalidation strategy needed

### Implications for Phase 4

**Graph Operations:**
- May need caching for performance
- Path normalization critical for link analysis
- Test with various vault structures

**Template System:**
- Must handle path extensions consistently
- Test in both API and filesystem modes
- Validate frontmatter handling

**Bulk Operations:**
- Cache invalidation essential
- Progress reporting important for UX
- Dry-run mode critical for safety

**Advanced Search:**
- Test regex patterns for performance
- Verify consistency across modes
- Validate with large vaults
